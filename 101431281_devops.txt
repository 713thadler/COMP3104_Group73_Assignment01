COMP 3104 DevOps: Practical Skills for Modern Software Development

COMP 3104, DevOps, is part of the Computer Programming and Analysis program at George Brown College. In this course, students learn essential DevOps practices, all aimed at boosting both productivity and teamwork between development and operations teams. The course covers a range of tools and techniques, from continuous integration and deployment strategies to containerization and cloud services. Students also get practical, hands-on experience applying these concepts in real-world settings, which helps prepare them for industry challenges.

The course focuses on practical, hands-on learning, with lab exercises that let students apply DevOps techniques using industry-standard tools like Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub. Students also learn how to set up CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, helping ensure their code is smoothly integrated and deployed. By working with these tools, students develop a strong foundation for managing software development lifecycles.

Another key part of the course is encouraging cross-team collaboration, which is essential in DevOps environments. Students learn about version control systems (VCS) and workflows that allow developers and IT staff to work together smoothly. The course also covers important architectural decisions, helping students understand the differences between monolithic and microservice architectures, so they can make informed decisions when building scalable, reliable applications.

COMP 3104 gets students ready for a career in DevOps by introducing them to cloud platforms and infrastructure-as-code (IaC). Students learn the advantages of cloud computing and how to deploy applications on cloud infrastructure. The course also explores key industry trends, different DevOps roles, and the growing market demand, giving students the skills and knowledge they need to pursue careers as DevOps engineers.
