In this course, students learn essential DevOps practices, all aimed at boosting both productivity and teamwork between development and operations teams. The course covers a range of tools and techniques, from continuous integration and deployment strategies to containerization and cloud services. Students also get practical, hands-on experience applying these concepts in real-world settings, which helps prepare them for industry challenges.

The course focuses on practical, hands-on learning, with lab exercises that let students apply DevOps techniques using industry-standard tools like Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub. Students also learn how to set up CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, helping ensure their code is smoothly integrated and deployed. By working with these tools, students develop a strong foundation for managing software development lifecycles.
