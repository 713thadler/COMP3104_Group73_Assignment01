The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** consists of several key phases:
 **planning, development, testing, deployment,** and **maintenance**. Within this 
 framework, **DevOps** plays a crucial role by fostering seamless collaboration between
  development and operations teams. 

Through the implementation of **CI/CD pipelines**, DevOps enables continuous integration, 
testing, and deployment of software, significantly reducing bottlenecks and ensuring a faster
 development cycle. Furthermore, DevOps practices support scalability by leveraging 
 **microservices architecture** and **cloud-based solutions**, leading to more efficient, 
 flexible, and reliable software delivery.
